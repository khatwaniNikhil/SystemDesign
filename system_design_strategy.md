# Non Functional Requirements
   1. Scalabilty: Data size increase and traffic size increase planning
   2. Service level objectives: P95, P99 API percentiles, Availability
   3. Backup: critical components, backup frequency
   4. Security: PII handling verus third party delegation, regulatory requirements, password storage, OWASP
   5. External Integrations
   6. Analytics/OLAP-DW 

# Main components and connections b/w them

# Common bottlenecks
