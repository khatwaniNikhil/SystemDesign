# Flash Sale
At the most basic level, they r limited availability sales in qty or time

# Functional 
1. in case of too high load, backpressure with proper message to buyer

    ![](https://github.com/khatwaniNikhil/SystemDesign/blob/main/images/ux_backpressure.png)
    
2. First come first served and fair throttling - some user waiting endlessly versus some user get lucky nd placed order as soon as they came
3. avoid undersell: user dropped during the checkout process - payment failure, network issue etc.
4. avoid over sell - race conditions around deduction of inventory with highly concurrent user requests.
5. identifying malicious users & bots - tendency to purchase and later sale at higher price in secondary market
6. Avoid mutiple charges - leading to customer complaints to credit cards and merchant has to bear dispute fees

# Non Functional
1. handle high read load - storefront
2. handle high write load and interact with external services - checkout 
    1. Inventory deduction throughput of a Single Product upto 1k per sec - flipkart flash sale numbers
3. handle high read & write mix - shopify admin managing OMS & WMS

5. high availability
    1. users are able to buy products, merchants able to sell products easily
6. low latency
7. scalable
8. Observability
9. manage ddos: unfair means will be used due to competitiveness and limited inventory on sale
10. considering high profile social media celebrity sell their white labelled inventory - social media customer back lash to be avoided at any cost

# Scale Assumptions
1. Around 110 orders per sec - 10 million orders in day
2. Based on flipkart past sale no's, 600 million requests during flash sale, on avg. 6 million req per day on non flash sale service

# System Design
## Nginx 
1. throttle using leaky bucket algo
    1. once user's checkout is throttled - he is shown throttle page(cached by LB)
    2. as per the UX requirement(refer functional requirement section) - throttled page javascript will keep polling the LB to see if there is enough capacity 
    3. once LB gives go ahead to checkout, we places securely signed cookie in user session to avoid rethrolling the same user and let him complete checkout

4. **stateless fair throttling** of users **managing any state around request originate time which can later be spof**
   1. define lag delimeter - time elapsed since start of sale
       1. during non sale hours - lag delimeter is current time(all requests are high priority and no one is throttled)
       2. during flash sale - bucket fills quickly, lb will notice this and fine tune lag delimeter in order to reach goal of 16 (size of leaky bucket) requests hitting the bucket, if more than 16 requests are reaching bucket then all will be throttled
   3. basis before/after lag delimeter - categorize requests into high and low  priority
   4. low priority immediately throttled
   5. high priority go through leaky bucket 
   6. leaky bucket is per load balancer
   7. capacity of each leak bucket = total capacity/no. of load balancers
   
6. prevents ddos
   1. blacklisting & whitleisting ip support
   2. per ip limit no. of reqs in a min. etc.
   3. limit max connections to webserver
   4. close slow connections
7. event loop based architecture - scalable to high load of http requests
8. customised nginx - openresty as application load balancer
    1. shopify used openresty - written on top of nginx - adding luaJIT to write lua scripts to modify the flow of requests 
        1. shopify leveraged the same to create http router to enable multi dc
        2. muti dc caching framework
        3. additional logging


## Cache 
1. Cache api responses which r mostly static like item description

## Server
1. until user clicks checkout, manager cart via redis.
2. Increasing availability and response time of external facing application server
    1. offloading work to background workers via mq
        1. on new user signup - sending email can be done asyncronously
        2. image processing on upload to website - 
        3 server response is somewhat the image has been uploaded successfully, it will appear on the website later if things go as planned
4. idempotent key based api design to avoid duplicate charges
 
## Database
1. row level lock for inventory update: lot of contention in case of million req/sec
2. select for update no wait
    1. customer waiting time can be reduced using sql no wait where customer req thread does not wait for db level lock but user exp. still be bad as we will have to tell him to try again later
2. first level advisory lock with second level row lock 
    1. user enforced db level lock does not need to lock row/table in db. its object is an integer - lightweight & highly performant as does not need to db row or table level data
    2. use db entity PK/ID field for adivosry lock key
    3. QPS of single advisory lock in handling concurrent update requests for one record can reach 391,000/s
    4. 32-core, 64-thread computer can handle 1.31 million requests per second.
    5. the state of product will be changed to sold out quickly, avoiding a waste of database resources.
    6. advisory lock reduces cpu utilisation drastically

## Architecture
1. overprovision infra dedicated to sales
2. store data in binary format like avro or protobuf for memory gains
3. read replicas versus cache
     1. read replica will be size constrained as each read replica will store complete data
     2. cache will be faster and size can be tuned/managed via TTL 

## UI
1. load balancer with auto scale UI service
2. CDN hosting of static assets
3. avoided repeated click by user: disable submit btn once clicked
4. avoid unnecessary multiple api calls
    1. Lodash-debounce: for example - time threshold based wait for user typing to complete before next api hit to backend
    2. Axios HTTP Request Cancellation: for example - video streaming user has jumped to future time, just immediate chunk is no longer to be fetched
